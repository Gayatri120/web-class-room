INTRODUCTION

"Web Classroom" project is a web-based classroom management system designed to facilitate online learning and academic administration. It provides a structured platform for students, faculty, and administrators to engage in a virtual learning environment. The system includes features for user authentication, content management, and assessment handling, ensuring a seamless educational experience.
The project is built using PHP for backend processing, likely interacting with a database for storing user data, assessments, and other educational materials. The presence of various PHP files indicates functionalities for user registration, faculty and student management, and multimedia integration. POSTGRESQL Server is used as the backbone by the
Web classroom system, eliminating the risk of data loss and ensuring data security. Additionally, an .htaccess file suggests security measures for controlling access and permissions within the system.
The project is structured systematically, with PHP files managing backend logic, likely supporting a database-driven approach. It is expected that there are additional resources such as JavaScript, CSS, or a database schema to support its functionality.
This system is particularly useful for educational institutions looking to digitize their learning processes. By incorporating administrative tools and interactive learning components, Web Classroom enables a more efficient and accessible online learning environment.


1.1	Needs Web Classroom

•	Assessment & Performance Tracking
•	Scalability & Customization

1.2	Literature Survey 
In recent years, web-based learning management systems (LMS) have gained significant importance in the education sector. Platforms like Moodle, Google Classroom, and Blackboard have set the standard for online learning by providing tools for course management, student engagement, and assessment tracking. The Web Classroom project follows a similar approach by integrating key features required for an efficient virtual classroom environment. 
Research in online education highlights the importance of user-friendly interfaces, automated grading, and interactive content. Studies suggest that LMS platforms should incorporate 
The project aligns with these advancements by providing structured content management and user authentication, making it a useful tool for modern e-learning environments. However, further enhancements such as AI-driven grading, discussion forums, and mobile optimization could improve its usability. 
The system appears to be a custom-built LMS with features tailored for an educational institution's specific needs. Unlike commercial solutions, it provides self-hosted control over user data, allowing administrators to manage student records, faculty accounts, and assessments within a secure environment  
1.3	Scope of Proposed System
The Web Classroom system is designed to serve as a comprehensive digital learning platform, offering features that enhance online education, student engagement, and administrative efficiency. The system aims to facilitate seamless communication between students, faculty, and administrators, allowing for streamlined course management, assessment distribution, and resource sharing.
The Web Classroom system is ideal for educational institutions, tutoring,    and training organizations looking to transition to an online learning model. With its structured environment, it can support virtual classrooms, assignment tracking, and faculty-student interactions, making education more accessible and organized. The system’s extensibility also allows for future enhancements, such as integrating real-time communication tools or AI-driven analytics for student performance tracking.
